## Operating System Notes

###  What is OS
An *operating system* is a piece of software that manages all the resources of a computer system, both hardware and software, and provides an environment in which the user can execute his/her programs in a convenient and efficient manner by hiding underlying complexity of the hardware and acting as a resource manager.

### Why OS?
#### 1. What if there is no OS? 

1.  Apps would become very bulky and complex 
Every application (like Chrome, VLC, MS Word) would need to handle hardware directly.

- That means each app would have to know how to control the CPU, memory, keyboard, printer, etc.

2. One app could take over all resources (CPU, RAM, etc.)

- Without an OS, there's no one to control how long an app runs or how much memory it takes.

- So one greedy app can block other apps or even crash the system.

3.  No memory protection = Apps can corrupt each other
- Without memory protection, one app could access or change the memory of another app.

- This could lead to data loss, crashes, or security issues.

### An operating system function -
- Access to the computer hardware.
- interface between the user and the computer hardware
- Resource management (Aka, Arbitration) (memory, device, file, security, process etc)
- Hides the underlying complexity of the hardware. (Aka, Abstraction)
- The Operating System (OS) helps run your apps (like Chrome, Zoom, VLC) safely and smoothly by:

  Isolation – Keeping each program in its own space

    Protection – Preventing programs from harming each other or the system
