#  Multi-Level Queue (MLQ) vs Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)

---

## üî∑ Multi-Level Queue Scheduling (MLQ)

- The **ready queue is divided into multiple separate queues**.
- Each process is **permanently assigned** to one queue based on certain criteria:
  - Process priority
  - Process type (system/interactive/batch)
  - Memory usage
  - CPU burst characteristics

### Characteristics:
- **Rigid structure**: A process stays in its assigned queue permanently.
- **Each queue** has its own scheduling algorithm:
  - System processes ‚Üí Round Robin
  - Interactive processes ‚Üí Round Robin
  - Batch processes ‚Üí FCFS
- **Scheduling between queues** is done via **priority scheduling** (e.g., fixed priority).

### ‚ùå Drawbacks:
- **No flexibility**: Process stuck in one queue
- **Starvation**: Lower priority queues may never get CPU
- **Convoy effect**: Long process blocks others

## üî∑ Multi-Level Feedback Queue Scheduling (MLFQ)

- Similar to MLQ but **flexible**: processes can **move between queues** based on behavior.
- Designed to **differentiate between I/O-bound and CPU-bound processes** dynamically.

### Characteristics:
- **Adaptive**: If a process uses too much CPU, it's moved to a **lower-priority queue**.
- If a process **waits too long**, it is moved to a **higher-priority queue** (called **aging**).
- **Preemptive**: A higher priority queue can interrupt a lower one.

### ‚úÖ Advantages:
- **Reduces starvation** using aging
- **Supports interactive processes** effectively
- **Improves responsiveness** and resource usage

### üîÅ Sample Queue Design:

| Queue Level      | Type                | Scheduling Algo |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| 1 (Highest)      | System processes    | RR               |
| 2                | Interactive processes| RR              |
| 3 (Lowest)       | Batch processes     | FCFS             |
