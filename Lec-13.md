#  CPU Scheduling | SJF | Priority | Round Robin

---

## üß† 1. Shortest Job First (SJF)

### SJF ‚Äì Non-Preemptive

- Process with the **smallest Burst Time (BT)** is selected first.
- Once CPU is assigned, the process runs till completion.
- Requires **prior knowledge or estimation** of BT, which is often **inaccurate or impossible**.

#### üîª Issues:
- Suffers from **convoy effect**: if the first process has a long BT, others must wait.
- May cause **starvation** for long jobs.
- **Selection criteria**: `AT + BT`

---

### SJF ‚Äì Preemptive (Also called Shortest Remaining Time First - SRTF)

- Process with the **shortest remaining BT** gets CPU.
- If a new process arrives with a **shorter BT**, it **preempts** the current one.

#### ‚úÖ Benefits:
- Less starvation compared to non-preemptive SJF.
- No convoy effect.
- Gives **minimum average waiting time** in many scenarios.

## üéØ 2. Priority Scheduling

### Priority ‚Äì Non-Preemptive

- Each process is assigned a **priority** at the time of creation.
- The process with the **highest priority** (lowest number) is executed first.
- **SJF is a special case of priority scheduling** where priority is inversely proportional to BT.

### Priority ‚Äì Preemptive

- If a new process arrives with a **higher priority** than the current one, it **preempts** it.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem:
- May cause **indefinite starvation** of low-priority processes.

#### ‚úÖ Solution: Ageing
- Gradually **increase priority** of long-waiting processes.
- Example: Increase priority by 1 every 15 minutes.

## üîÅ 3. Round Robin (RR) Scheduling

- Most **widely used** CPU scheduling algorithm.
- Like FCFS but **preemptive**, designed for **time-sharing systems**.

### Key Features:
- Each process is given a **fixed time quantum (TQ)**.
- If the process does not finish within TQ, it is **preempted** and moved to the end of the ready queue.
- CPU scheduling decision is based on `AT + TQ`, **not on BT**.

### ‚úÖ Advantages:
- No starvation.
- No convoy effect.
- Easy to implement.
- Good responsiveness for all processes.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Trade-Off:
- If **TQ is too small**: too many context switches (high overhead)
- If **TQ is too large**: behaves like FCFS
